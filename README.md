### 🤵 - About me 
- > I'm a Java/JavaScript Developer focusing on Minecraft and Discord Development.
- > A Majority of the work I have done is closed work but I'm currently working on expanding my public facing work within my portfolio!
- > I dropped out of University in the United Kingdom after nearly 4 Years due to my Mental and Physical Health. During that time I learnt about my limits and what I truly want to do.
